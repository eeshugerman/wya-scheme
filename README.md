# Write Yourself a Scheme
This is my implementation of the Scheme programming language, based on a book called [Write Yourself a Scheme in 48 Hours](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Write_Yourself_a_Scheme_in_48_Hours).

It's taking a lot longer than 48 hours. Is it really supposed to take 48 hours?!?

If you're here because you're working through the book yourself and are looking for a reference implementation, this probably isn't the one you want. While it is _in essence_ mostly in line with the book, you'll be hard-pressed to find common code snippets -- most every thing is rewritten in my own words and with different variable names. Also, I take some queues from [Write Yourself a Scheme, Version 2](https://wespiser.com/writings/wyas/home.html), which is quite different.
